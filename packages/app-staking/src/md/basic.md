# Nominators

Nominators have a responsibility to elect the most trustworthy validators to secure the network.  
To become a nominator you must stake the minimum required CENNZ tokens and vote for your preferred validators.  

Important things to note are:
- Nominators share proportionally in CPAY rewards according to their contributed stake, if their validator(s) are elected and participate correctly.
- If elected validators behave maliciously, nominators' stake will be slashed proportionally alongside the validator's.

e.g. if a nominator contributes 30% of a validators total stake they may receive 30% of the reward. Conversely, nominator will share 30% of slashes (confiscation of CENNZ) if the validator misbehaves.

- Nominators are encouraged and incentivized to stay aware of validator activity and change their nominations if required.

# Validators
Operate CENNZnet nodes to make blocks and participate in consensus protocols securing the network.  

- Validators have a right to set a % commission rate reward which will be deducted before sharing with nominators.  
- Validators earn CPAY rewards but can incur slash if they misbehave in the protocol.
- Validators with the highest total stake are elected
